# 3DModellingFree
ðŸš€ 3D modelling is becoming more and more popular nowadays. Many people start exploring it, but often get bored with common models or struggle to find projects that are truly exciting, challenging, and detailed.

Even when they do find something interesting, it can be difficult to access full technical drawings or data sheets to really push their skills further.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m more than happy to share the projects I worked on during my time at university. These models are not just practice piecesâ€”theyâ€™re real challenges designed for anyone who loves 3D modelling and wants to take their skills to the next level.

ðŸ”§ If youâ€™re passionate about CAD and 3D design, these projects might be exactly what youâ€™re looking for.
